# MongoDBScraper

 # INTRODUCTION
I created a web app that lets users view and leave comments on the latest news scraped from DnD.Wizards.com.

# TECHNOLOGIES USED
This app has been coded in Javascript and the scraping is done with Cheerio and Axios. HandlebarsJS is used as the frontend framework with Express and Morgan managing the middleware. Node.js, Mongoose.js (ODM), and MongoDB are used for backend data management. The Colors and Styles were brought to you by Materialize CSS and HTML.
